# Hello World: Intro to Data Types

In the vast realm of programming, data types play a crucial role. They're the building blocks that help us organize and manipulate data efficiently. Imagine them as the DNA of your code – guiding how it behaves and interacts.

## Hello World with Go
Before we go deep, let's start with a classic "Hello World" using fmt.Println(). This simple line of code lays the foundation for our journey into Golang's syntax.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Gophers!")
}
```

## Intro : Data Types
Now, let's meet the Golang family of basic data types: `integers`, `floats`, `strings`, and `bools`. Each has its own unique role in handling different kinds of information.
